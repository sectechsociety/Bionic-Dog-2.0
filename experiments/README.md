# Experiments

This directory allows for rapid prototyping and R&D.

## Guidelines

- Create a new subdirectory for each experiment (e.g., `exp_01_servo_test`, `exp_02_yolo_integration`).
- Include a separate `README.md` in each experiment folder describing the hypothesis, setup, and results.
- Code here is experimental and not guaranteed to be production-ready.
