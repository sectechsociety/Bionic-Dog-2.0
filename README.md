# Bionic Dog Development Platform

An advanced research and development framework for quadrupedal robotics.

## Overview

The Bionic Dog Development Platform provides a comprehensive software suite for analyzing, controlling, and interacting with bionic quadruped robots. Designed for engineering and research applications, this repository serves as a centralized knowledge base and control interface, abstracting low-level hardware complexity to enable high-level application development.

## Scope

This platform covers the full spectrum of robotic development:

- **Hardware Abstraction**: Detailed analysis and documentation of electromechanical subsystems and firmware protocols.
- **Control Systems**: Implementation of kinematic solvers, gait generation algorithms, and motion control logic.
- **Perception**: Integration of computer vision pipelines for effective object detection, tracking, and environmental awareness.
- **Application Layer**: A robust Python-based API for building complex, interactive, and autonomous behaviors.

## Features

- **Unified Control Interface**: RESTful API for seamless robot command and telemetry.
- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Support for voice commands, visual navigation, and manual dashboard control.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Protocols for synchronized movement and communication between multiple units.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design supporting integration with ROS2, modern ML frameworks, and custom sensor payloads.
